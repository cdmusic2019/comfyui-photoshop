本版本是在原版v1.93基础上进行优化和升级，现已支持高清，多图，和云端使用。

 一，功能重写：

   1. 蒙版
          对蒙版（mask)的获取代码进行了重写，让它可以支持ps最新版本。支持ps2024-ps2026,输出标准的黑白蒙版

    2. rgthree节点支持最新版本：
           对工作流分组节点同步代码进行了重写，可以支持最新版本的rgthree,代码上增加更多的颜色匹配方式，更容易同步工作流，增加傻瓜式同
      步方法，只要工作流中有一个

    3. 图片传输均使用二进制（快速）
          对图片（蒙版除外）的传输方式进行了重写，包括从ps获取图片，或comfyui生成的图片发送到PS,弃用了原来的编码方式（base64编码），采
       用二进制的方式来传送，获取最快的传输速率。

    4. 图片清晰度优化。
           首先是从PS获取图片，原版本获取的是PS的预览，由于图片较小（1024x1024）只有50-80kb,图片质量较低，放大会模糊，有伪影。 现已对获
       取函数进行了重写，直接获取PS元图片，清晰度和PS一致，文档较大，一般1K的图片 在3M-4M，2K的图片大小10-20M左右，4K的图片 30-40M左右。
       目前本地使用时支持5400x5400分辨率（85M），超出会压缩（云端使用时3500x3500PX,35M）。另外，从comfyui传送图片到ps不再压缩，保持comfyui
       生成图片时的清晰度和文件大小。

    5. PS端图片容器重写（最大支持9张图片）
           原版本只支持1张图片（1x1）显示。现在对容器进行了重写，增加了2x2 和3x3的图片网格，支持从comfyui发送到PS的图片数量是1-9张，根据
       图片数量使用不同的网格。（PS端接收图片的逻辑是图片组（image batch）,无论用何种方式生成的batch都可以输送到ps中）

    6. 新增云端支持，
           可以支持云端comfyui.但需要云端支持安装插件和加载插件目录中的JS。我测试的环境是：仙宫云，autodl 算力云。其他云自行测试。（端脑云
       暂不支持，因为JS不能加载）
 
二，界面或UI修复。
    1.插面板版悬浮层优化，种子，提示词同步，其他更多优化自行体验。
    2.修复了一个经典的BUB，就是comfyui能连上PS，但PS不能发送到comfyui的BUG。
    3.社区中见到的大部份bug都已经修复。

总之，这个版本应该是目前最完整的版本，优化了很多地方，可能透过界面你看不出来，但你明显能感觉得传输速度的提升和更加稳定，以及图片质量的提高。

优化日历：

最新优化：

2026.1.30
添加了云端支持。把IP优化为动态IP，动态端口，支持本地PS连接上云端comfyui.(前提条件是需要云端能完整的安装本插件，包括运行插件的JS代码)

2026.1.24：
重构了 Photoshop → ComfyUI 的集成，以实现细粒度、确定性的缓存，同时保持简洁且向后兼容的工作流程。优化了IS_CHANGED函数，以及缓存机制，让处理更快速。

 主要包括： 
     1. 将“🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin“进行了细化，分解为：图片蒙版，种子，提示词，滑块值等单独的节点，节点名称为："🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin"，"🔹Photoshop Seed"，"🔹Photoshop Prompts"，"🔹Photoshop Slider"，搭建工作流时可以单独使用它们，让工作流变得更简单高效。

     2. 兼容以前的工作流，增加新节点的同时，暂时保留了初始节点，🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin(aio),如果你使用原版工作流，它仍然可以正常使用，不需做任何修改。
   感谢Michoko92的对代码的优化，本重构代码均由：Michoko92 提供！

2026.1.24
Refactored the integration of Photoshop → ComfyUI to achieve fine-grained, deterministic caching while maintaining a streamlined and backward-compatible workflow. Optimized the IS_CHANGED function and caching mechanism for faster processing.

Main updates include:

1.The "🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin" has been refined and broken down into separate nodes for image masks, seeds, prompts, slider values, etc. The node names are: "🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin," "🔹Photoshop Seed," "🔹Photoshop Prompts," "🔹Photoshop Slider." These can be used individually when building workflows, making the workflow simpler and more efficient.
2.Compatibility with previous workflows is maintained. While new nodes have been added, the original node "🔹Photoshop ComfyUI Plugin (aio)" is temporarily retained. If you are using the original workflow, it will continue to function normally without any modifications.
Thanks to Michoko92. The refactored code was provided by Michoko92!

Release Notes - Version Update

This version is built upon the original v1.93 with fixes, optimizations, and upgrades, incorporating multiple repairs and improvements along with new features:

1. Function Rewrites:

   1.1 Mask
      The code for obtaining masks has been rewritten to support the latest versions of Photoshop. It now supports PS2024–PS2026 and outputs standard black-and-white masks.

   1.2 rgthree Node Support for the Latest Version
      The workflow grouping node synchronization code has been rewritten to support the latest version of rgthree. More color-matching methods have been added to the code, making workflow synchronization easier (especially if you are still using older workflow versions).

   1.3 Image Transfer Optimization
      The image transfer method (excluding masks) has been rewritten, including fetching images from Photoshop or sending images generated by ComfyUI to Photoshop. The previous encoding method (base64 encoding) has been deprecated in favor of a binary approach to achieve the fastest transfer rates.

   1.4 Image Clarity Optimization
      First, the method of fetching images from Photoshop has been rewritten. The original version retrieved PSR previews, which were smaller (1024x1024) at only 50–80 KB, resulting in lower image quality, blurriness when enlarged, and artifacts. The new function directly retrieves the original Photoshop images, maintaining the same clarity as in Photoshop. File sizes are larger, typically 3–4 MB for 1K images, 10–20 MB for 2K images, and 30–40 MB for 4K images. The system now supports high-definition retrieval up to 5400x5400 resolution; anything beyond this will be compressed.
      Additionally, images transferred from ComfyUI to Photoshop are no longer compressed, preserving the clarity and file size of the images generated by ComfyUI.

   1.5 Photoshop Image Container Rewrite (Supports Up to 9 Images)
      The original version only supported displaying one image (1x1). The container has been rewritten to include 2x2 and 3x3 image grids, supporting 1–9 images sent from ComfyUI to Photoshop. Different grids are used depending on the number of images. (The logic for receiving images on the Photoshop side is image batches, meaning batches generated in any way can be sent to Photoshop.)

2. Interface or UI Fixes:

   2.1 The three icons in the upper-left corner of the Photoshop plugin have been reduced to two-thirds of their original size, and the slider on the right has been changed to a thin bar to display more image elements.

   2.2 The seed box, prompt box, and double-arrow functionality have been optimized to synchronize and display seeds and prompts, including those in the settings panel.

   2.3 The prompt input box in the front panel now supports Chinese input. Delayed and mouse detection events have been added to allow direct Chinese input. Note: When inputting Chinese, ensure the mouse is placed anywhere inside the plugin and not on the input method candidate box, as this could unexpectedly close the prompt input box and prevent input.

   2.4 The scaling parameters "DownScale if Bigger" and "Upscale if Smaller" in the settings panel have been optimized. Changes now take effect immediately without restarting the plugin, as long as there is any change (including selections) in the Photoshop canvas.

   2.5 The progress bar has been improved to preload whenever a render action occurs, allowing users to immediately know when ComfyUI is running.

   2.6 Fixed a potential bug where frequent invalid connections from Photoshop in a short period could cause a permanent disconnection on the server, leading to persistent loss of connectivity. Previously, the solution was to delete the `comfyui-photoshop` folder under the custom node in ComfyUI and replace it with a new copy. This issue has been resolved and should no longer occur.

   2.7 Most bugs reported in the community have been fixed.

In summary, this version is currently the most comprehensive one, with many optimizations that may not be visible through the interface. However, users will clearly notice improvements in transfer speed, stability, and image quality.
